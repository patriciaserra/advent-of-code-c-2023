# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions in C 🎄

**Welcome to my Advent of Code 2023 repository!**

This is a collection of my solutions to the fantastic puzzles of [AOC](https://adventofcode.com/) 2023.

You can check out my [Advent of Code profile](https://adventofcode.com/2023/leaderboard/private/view/3454791) to see my progress.

All solutions are written in C programming language.

## Directory Structure
```markdown
/day01
├── input.txt
├── day01_part1.c
├── day01_part2.c
/day02
├── input.txt
├── day02_part1.c
├── day02_part2.c
...
```

Each day's directory contains an `input.txt` file with the puzzle input and two `dayx_partx.c` files containing the C code for solving part 1 and 2 of the challenges.

## Getting Started

To get started with these solutions, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/advent-of-code-2023-c.git
```

Make sure to replace `your-username` with your username 😊

## Compiling and Running the Solutions

Navigate to the specific day's directory, compile the C code, and run the executable:

```bash
cd day01
gcc day01_part1.c -o solution
./solution
```

## Notes and Considerations

This is my first time participating in the AOC. ☃️

Feel free to make any suggestions, it's greatly appreciated. 🌟

Input files are named input.txt, and the code assumes the puzzle input is available in this file. ❄️

Sometimes, however, when the puzzle input is quite short, I include it in the solutions. In this case, the input.txt file is not necessary for the code to work. 🤶
