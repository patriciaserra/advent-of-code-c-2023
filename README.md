# Advent of Code 2023 in C ðŸŽ„

**Welcome to my Advent of Code 2023 repository!**

This is a collection of my solutions to the fantastic puzzles of [AOC](https://adventofcode.com/) 2023. \
These solutions have been coded in the C programming language.

Unfortunately I did not solve all puzzles, better luck next year :)

## Directory Structure
```markdown
/day01
â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ day01_part1.c
â”œâ”€â”€ day01_part2.c
/day02
â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ day02_part1.c
â”œâ”€â”€ day02_part2.c
...
```

Each day's directory contains an `input.txt` file with the puzzle input and two `dayx_partx.c` files containing the C code for solving part 1 and 2 of the challenges.

## Getting Started

To get started with these solutions, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/advent-of-code-2023-c.git
```

Make sure to replace `your-username` with your username ðŸ˜Š

## Compiling and Running the Solutions

Navigate to the specific day's directory, compile the C code, and run the executable:

```bash
cd day01
gcc day01_part1.c -o solution
./solution
```

## Notes and Considerations

This is my first time participating in the AOC. 

I started learning C on September 2023. Therefore, my knowledge is limited, and my code will most certainly be messy.

Feel free to make any suggestions; it's greatly appreciated ðŸŒŸ

Input files are named input.txt, and the code assumes the puzzle input is available there.

Sometimes, however, when the puzzle input is quite short, I include it in the solutions. In that case, the input.txt file will not be necessary for the code to work.

## How to Contribute

Contributions are more than welcome! If you'd like to leave your touch in this project, please follow the typical guidelines:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your magical code.
3. Make your changes and submit a pull request.
